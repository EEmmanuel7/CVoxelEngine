# CVoxelEngine
A C++ Voxel Engine, to succeed my Java Voxel Engine.  Uses SDL, and may use OpenCL in the future.

## Building
You can build this project with Microsoft Visual Studio.  Project files are provided.

### Libraries
You need to install the SDL dlls in your system root directory.  I have provided the 64-bit SDL dlls in the lib folder of this repository, which you'd install in %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64 (e.g. C:\Windows\SysWOW64).

## Release
Check out the releases section for compiled builds.

## Usage
